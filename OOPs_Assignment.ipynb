        "# Theoritical Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
        "- OOPs is the concept having classes and objects dealing with methods and attributes\n",
        "- Each class can have multiple instances\n",
        "- Contribute as - Abstraction , Encapsulation , Inheritance , Polymorphism\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP\n",
        "- A class is like a blueprint for creating objects .\n",
        "- Has Various methods and attributes to deal with , which is being utilised by the objects for performing multiple operations\n",
        "- Memory location is not created for classes until the instances are created\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP\n",
        "- An object is the instance of the class\n",
        "- Has actual data values and deals with multiple methods for performing variious operations\n",
        "- More then one object can be created for a single class\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "- Abstraction is the method of hiding unnecessary and confidential data and used to get access of the neccesary attributes only\n",
        "- Anstraction is achieved using abc library as import abc and the function that has to be the abstract method is headed with the @abc.abstractmethod\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the process of bundling data that helps to restrict the control over the data\n",
        "- has access specifiers such as public , private and restricted access specifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python\n",
        "- Dunder methods are the special methods that are used to perform specific tasks\n",
        "- They are called automatically\n",
        "- Some of the examples of dunder methods are __init__ , __call__ , __str__ etc\n",
        "- Strings , integers all has various dunder methods\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "- Inheritance lets one class reuse another class attributes & methods\n",
        "- The parent class shares functionality with the child class\n",
        "- The attributes and methods of the parent class can be acceseed by the child class itself\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "- Polymorphism can be achieved in two forms - Method Overloading and Method Overriding\n",
        "- Method overloading is not directly supported by the python but indirectly\n",
        "- has same name but is defined differently\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python\n",
        "- Encapsulation is achieved by making the attributes privated data members and methods and restricted\n",
        "- private data member is named as __DataMember\n",
        "- Restricted data member is named as _DataMember\n",
        "- Ex-\n",
        "      - class Account:\n",
        "           def __init__(self):\n",
        "               self.__balance = 0\n",
        "           def deposit(self, amt):\n",
        "               self.__balance += amt\n",
        "           def get_balance(self):\n",
        "               return self.__balance\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python\n",
        "- COnstructer is the the method which is called itself when the object is been created\n",
        "- __init__ method acts as a constructer in python\n",
        "- Used in python for initializing attributes or data members in python\n",
        "- Ex -\n",
        "      class Student:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "           self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "- class methods are the methods which are associated with the class otself\n",
        "- defined as @classmethod\n",
        "- Static methods do not depend on class or object\n",
        "- static methods are used to access the methods without the objects directly\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "- Method verloading means same method name with different parameter list\n",
        "- Python does not support true method overloading\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP\n",
        "- When a child class defines a method with the same name as its parent class\n",
        "- The childs version replaces the parents implementation or definition\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        "- @property allows a method to be accessed like an attribute\n",
        "- Used commonly for getters , setters and deleters\n",
        "- Improves readability and provide access in a much more controlled manner\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        "- It lets one interface work with different data types or object\n",
        "- Enables the same method to behave differently across classes\n",
        "- Makes code more flexible, reusable, and maintainable\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        "- Abstract classes are defined using the abc library\n",
        "- They can have abstract methods that must be implemented in child classes\n",
        "- They serve as a blueprint for subclasses\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        "- Code reusability via inheritance and polymorphism\n",
        "- Encapsulation makes programs secure and modular\n",
        "- Easy maintenance and scalability of large systems\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "- A class can inherit from more than one parent class\n",
        "- Useful when combining functionalities from different classes\n",
        "- Python resolves conflicts using MRO Method Resolution Order\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        "- Class variable:\n",
        "    - Belongs to the class itself.\n",
        "    - Shared by all objects (instances) of the class.\n",
        "    - Defined outside the constructor (__init__).\n",
        "- Instance variable:\n",
        "    - Belongs to a specific object.\n",
        "    - Each object has its own copy.\n",
        "    - Defined inside the constructor (__init__) using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "- __str__: Returns a user-friendly string used with print() or str()\n",
        "- __repr__: Returns a developer and debug friendly string used in console or repr()\n",
        "- If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to __repr__\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "- super() is used to call methods or constructors from the parent class\n",
        "- It avoids code duplication when child classes extend parent functionality\n",
        "- Commonly used in inheritance and method overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "- __del__ is a destructor method, called when an object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "- Useful for cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources\n",
        "- It runs automatically when del obj is called or garbage collection happens\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        "- @staticmethod:\n",
        "    - Does not take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "    - Works like a normal function but lives inside a class.\n",
        "    - Cannot access or modify class state (cls) or instance state (self).\n",
        "- @classmethod:\n",
        "    - Takes cls (class itself) as the first parameter.\n",
        "    - Can access and modify class variables but not instance variables directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "- A parent class defines a method, and child classes override it with their own behavior\n",
        "- The same method call behaves differently depending on the object type\n",
        "- This enables runtime polymorphism, e.g., Dog.speak() vs Cat.speak()\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "- Method chaining allows multiple methods to be called in a single line\n",
        "- It works when methods return self instead of some other value\n",
        "- Makes the code cleaner and more fluent\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The method makes an object behave like a function.\n",
        "- When defined, you can use object_name(args) just like calling a function.\n",
        "- Commonly used in decorators, machine learning models, and callable objects."
